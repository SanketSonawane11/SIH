# The Only API - one API to rule them all!

- Are you annoyed having multiple APIs and SDKs in your project?
- Are you tired of maintaining too many dependencies? 
- Do you hate browsing documentations and learning new things?
- Have you looked for a one-size-fits-all solution solution but never found any?

Well... fear no more cause the The Only API is here!

### Highlights

- Strongly typed
- Infinite number of methods to call
- Supports all possible response data models
- Asynchronous
- Open source (duh!)
- Did I mention it's strongly typed?

## Getting Started

The Only API is available on NPM. To install it in your project type:

```
$ npm install theonlyapi
```

Then import it and create an instance, providing an OpenAI API key:

```ts
import TheApi from "theonlyapi";

const api = TheAPI("sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
```

## Usage

For each call, The Only API requires you to provide a function name you'd like to call, input parameters and then inside AsType method, a signature of the result data type you'd like to receive. You can start with something simple, like:

```ts
const result = await api.getTheAnswerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything().AsType({ answer: Number})

// { answer: 42 }
```

you can try to use some simple parameters:

```ts
const result = await api.addTwoNumbers([21,37]).AsType({ answer: Number})

// { answer: 58 }
```

and some more complicated ones:

```ts
const result = await api
  .getAverageTemperature({ location: "Berlin", month: "June", unit: "F" })
  .AsType({ temperature: Number });
  
//{ temperature: 71.3 }
```

or try more complex response types:

```ts
const result = await api
  .getBiggestCities({ country: "United States", page: 1, perPage: 5 })
  .AsType({
    data: [
      {
        name: String,
        population: Number,
        location: {
          lat: Number,
          lon: Number,
        },
      },
    ],
    page: Number,
    total: Number,
  });

```

## Disclaimer

Although The Only API is a production grade product, it might occasionally produce false results or return made-up data, but let's be honest - every software engineer prefers clean code over correctness of program execution, so enjoy anyways!
